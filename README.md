There needs to be a "Data" folder in the executable root, in this folder youll need to create a token.txt with your token in it, you also need to make 2 files called "defaultGuildID.txt" and "defaultChannelID". 

Writing your default settings for the direct console communication is option, as you can define your targeted guild and channel directly from the console window. If you put the IDs into these files the console will have these selected when the program starts, so you dont have to configure it every time.
